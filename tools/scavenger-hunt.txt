1. "ip addr" (or "ifconfig" if net-tools is installed). Bonus: simultaneous wifi
	and ethernet connections should yield two distinct network interfaces in the
	output of these commands, showing the IP address for each.
2. "ping HOSTNAME"
3. "nslookup IPADDRESS"
4. Use "scp" followed by info about receiving server; enter the password for
	that server to complete transfer. Using "sftp" also works, which puts the
	user into an interactive environment and is useful for transferring a
	number of files.
5. "lsof -i :PORT", although I believe this does not work on WSL (certainly WSL2
	at least) without using a workaround wherein port forwarding rules and
	firewall rules are removed and re-added.

6. "netstat -tulpn", but the same issue exists as in the previous question. The
	alternative in Windows Powershell is "Get-NetTCPConnection".
7. "wget 'URL'"
8. "curl -I URL"
9. The best answer I could find was to use tcpdump to monitor the interaction
	with a webpage and capture it as raw packets, then essentially format that
	data such that it is readable in an HTTP header style.

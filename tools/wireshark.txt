2. 
	Our computer used port 58430 for this interaction. Our client needed a port because it needs to receive 
	messages, and this port "directs" the information received from the server to the correct place.

4. 

	The full content of this frame excluding Ethernet, IP, TCP is metadata about the frame such as the network 
	interface our computer received it on, the time the frame arrived on our computer, the time this frame arrived 
	relative to the other frames, and other Wireshark metadata. The daytime protocol response itself includes
	information about what type of packet it is (a response) as well as the raw data corresponding to the actual
	date and time, the port it sent the response to on our computer, the standardization of the time, the source of 	the information (NIST) and an ending character (\n).
  
5. [SYN] indicates the start of a TCP session and these are the synchronization packets. 

6. [ACK] are the acknowledgment packets, acknowledging that data was correctly received. 

7. [FIN] indicates the end of a TCP session, i.e. that the session is finished. 

8. 
	The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection. We can tell because the first instance of [FIN] 	is being sent from port 13 to our port (58430).


===== HTTP =====


1. There were two TCP connections opened. One from port 36188 to port 80, and another from port 36190 to port 80.

2. 
	Yes, frame 7:
	7	0.045068312	10.0.2.15	45.79.89.123	HTTP	395	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
	This frame is the first HTTP request, and includes the GET header for /index.html

3.
	Yes, frame 11:
	11	0.124087917	10.0.2.15	45.79.89.123	HTTP	364	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1 
	This frame is an HTTP request, and includes the GET header for /jeff_square_head.jpg 





===== QUESTIONS =====

Why were two tcp connections opened when we requested a webpage? Why wouldn't just one work?

Why do some packets include parts such as: [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]? What do these mean?

What exactly is the hex info Wireshark includes? Is this all of the packet data? All of the frame information?

What does the second "Len" mean as opposed to the length column? How can some of the "Len" attributes be 0?
